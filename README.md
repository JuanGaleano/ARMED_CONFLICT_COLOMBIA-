# ARMED CONFLICT COLOMBIA: WHAT DATA CAN TELL US?

Between 1985 and 2018, Colombia experienced a multifaceted armed conflict involving the government, leftist guerrilla groups like FARC-EP and ELN, right-wing paramilitary forces such as the AUC, and powerful drug cartels. This period saw intense violence, including massacres, kidnappings, and widespread human rights abuses, significantly impacting the civilian population with hundreds of thousands killed and millions displaced. The conflict's roots are deep, intertwined with issues of land reform, social inequality, and drug trafficking. Various peace efforts, including the notable 2016 peace agreement with FARC, aimed to end the violence and address the underlying issues. However, despite demobilization initiatives and international support, challenges persisted with ongoing violence from remaining armed groups and criminal organizations. The conflict's legacy continues to shape Colombia's demographic landscape, presenting ongoing challenges in achieving lasting peace and justice for victims.      

On July 2023 the National Statistics Institute of Colombia (DANE) released a new dataset which provides a comprehensive quantitative record on human rights violations, including homicide, kidnapping, forced disappearance, and recruitment of minors from 1985 to 2018 in Colombia. This data was compiled from multiple administrative records and is subjected to statistical imputations to address missing information. It includes detailed victim demographics, event specifics, and the integration of over 112 databases. We use this rich dataset to analyze the demographic impact of the armed conflict in Colombia, identify victimization patterns, and assess the extent of underreporting. This analysis will support efforts to understand the conflict's full scope and contribute to historical clarity and policy-making aimed at preventing future violence.
